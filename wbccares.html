The company was struggling on gaining subscribers and they were losing the few they had at an alarming pace.</p>

Our users have all kinds of different backgrounds, printing knowledge and experience. We needed to unravel complexity into clarity.</p>

We unraveled the complexity and the technicality of the industry concepts leaning on visual aid and dividing it in understandable and easy steps, letting unexperienced users get familiar with the concepts, and allowing customization to more experienced ones. We designed an onboarding tool to help users understand the application, familiarize themselves with the different processes and decide on what level of expertise they want to work on.</p>
