                WBC Cares faced a challenge because they didn't have a simple and remote donation tool for their allies and supporters. This left them feeling powerless and frustrated about how to contribute effectively to the cause.</p>

            <p class="p section-p">As the core of the challenge was "to streamline the donation process", surrounded by several tasks, I did not want to jump right into ideating concepts based on assumptions. Instead, I tried to understand as much of the donating experience as possible in this limited time. This approach aimed to effectively communicate the values of the cause.</p>

            <h3 class="s-title">Research</h3>
            <p class="p section-p">Creating a donation experience is challenging due to the sensitive and emotional nature of the topic. Also, understanding the motivations and decision-making process behind donations can be complex, as it is influenced by personal values, beliefs, and priorities.</p>

                    <h5 class="rp-title">User interviews.</h5>
                    <p class="rp-content">As WBC Cares had a group of regular donors and partnerships with allied organizations, I chose to conduct user interviews with a selected subset of these individuals and organization representatives. The interviews aimed to gather insights into their experiences, motivations, and perspectives on WBC Cares' cause and donation process. This valuable information helps improve the organization's understanding of its supporters and enhance the donation experience.</p>
                    <p class="rp-content">When preparing the script, I focused on open-ended questions, enabling participants to freely share their emotions and thought processes when deciding to donate. I maintained an unbiased and open approach to identify their motivations. Creating a non-judgmental environment allowed me to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing their decision-making and understand their underlying motivations for donating.</p>
                    <!-- <p class="rp-content">The interviews were conducted in context. The participant and I stood in front of their wardrobe and went through details of different tasks surrounding the topic.</p> -->
